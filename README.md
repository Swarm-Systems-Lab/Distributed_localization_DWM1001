<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to develop a platform for **distributed algorithms** on the DWM1001C device, using a free and open source RTOS provided by **ChibiOS**. The DWM1001C includes a microcontroller and a transceptor to allow for wireless communication, we provide an interface between the hardware and a higher level API to implement distributed applications on real devices using **Ultra-Wideband** communications.

The project architecture is **layered**, providing different levels of abstraction for the different needs any application may have.

1. #### Hardware abstraction (Configure data rate, channel, timeout..) (Cross-platform)
2. #### Device Driver and peripherals (Drivers for DW1000, UART... on ChibiOS)
3. #### Communication and networking (API for sending, receiving, broadcasting...)
4. #### Application (Any application you wish to implement)
\
\
The application layer can benefit from a complete API in which sending a message to a device or receiving data is as easy as calling a function.
\
\
This project is a **WIP** so much of the functionality is still in development, any [contributions](#contributing) or suggestions are welcome.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage examples

Many distributed algorithms that rely on wireless communication between separate devices could be implemented using this platform, here are some examples we have begun working on and testing:

### Distributed localization for robot swarms

![dist-loc](docs/assets/dis_loc.gif)

_Distributed localization in a plane with 3 devices_

This application provides **relative positioning** information regarding the neighbours of each node on a distributed network, **without relying on any external infrastruture**. Using a Two-Way Ranging scheme distances between all neighbouring devices are obtained in a distributed fashion and, from these distances, relative position can be derived using trilateration.

### Consensus protocols

Many consensus algorithms such as **averaging** between devices require frequent information exchange, our platform provides an implementation opportunity to test and run these algorithms.

![centroid](docs/assets/centroid1.gif)

_Centroid estimation consensus algorithm, EXECUTED ON SIMULATION [Source](https://github.com/jesusBV20/source_seeking_distr/tree/master)_

This centroid estimation, can be implemented on real hardware using the communication API and creating an application which implements the algorithm's calculations and information exchange between devices.

## Anything you can think of

Using this platform a huge number of distributed algorithms can be implemented such as **clock synchronization**...

### Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Prerequisites

Prerequites are mostly inherited from ChibiOS and related to the architecture of the board, OS for development and debugging should be GNU/Linux or al least a POSIX compliant shell and GNU utilities

* **arm-none-eabi toolchain**
  
  GNU Embedded toolchain used to compile, link and debug code for embedded devices.

* **OpenOCD**
  
  Used to connect to the board and flash or debug the code. [OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/)

* **Jlink**
  
  Download from the official site, [Segger](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/).
  
  For Linux, if the tar package is chosen, the path of the installation should be appended to system **PATH** variable.


### Building

1. Clone the project repository ```git clone https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/Distributed_localization_DWM1001.git```
2. Prepare submodules
	- Initialize the submodules with ```git submodule init```
    - Sync with remote ```git submodule sync```
	- Download submodules ```git submodule update --recursive --remote```
3. Run ```make all``` to build all binaries.

### Flashing

1. Plug the board through USB and make sure it is detected as a device through lsusb.
2. Run ```make flash``` to flash with J-link or ```make openocd-flash```

### Debugging

1. Start the GDB server with ```make openocd-debug-server```
2. Open a GDB session with ```make openocd-debug```

A GBD server or session is created for each DWM1001-DEV board connected

If you use VSCode you can install the [Cortex-Debug](https://github.com/Marus/cortex-debug) extension to debug from the GUI.
